            <h3>1. What are the difference between sessionStorage and localStorage?</h3>
            <h4><strong>Answer:</strong> sessionStorage is similar to localStorage . The difference is that while data
                in localStorage doesn't
                expire,
                data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                particular
                tab
                in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

            <h3>2. What are the difference between global scope and block scope?</h3>
            <h4><strong>Answer:</strong> All the variable that is declared inside curly braces {} by let and const
                (aside from var). In addition variable declared inside a function (by
                let, const and var) has functional scope, and this variable cannot be access outside of the function. On
                the other and the global varible that can be accessed from anywhere in the context of browser they are
                found on window object(aside from let and const).

            <h3>3. How does event loop work?</h3>
            <h4><strong>Answer:</strong> The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking
                operations. All the synchronous tasks are stacked in a stack. The event loop continuously checks the
                call stack to see if there's any function that needs to run. After that for asynchronous tasks it checks
                queue. From heap memory waited task goes to the queue. And one by one complete the task.

            <h3>3. What are ways to get undefined as result?</h3>
            <h4><strong>Answer:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>Variable that is not initialized.</li>
                    <li>Function with no return.</li>
                    <li>Parameter that is not passed.</li>
                    <li>If return has nothing on the right side.</li>
                    <li>Object property that doesn't exist.</li>
                    <li>Accessing array elements outside of the index range.</li>
                    <li>Deleting element inside an array.</li>
                    <li>Set a value directly to undefined.</li>
